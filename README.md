## About Me

I am a full stack web developer who helps companies establish a strong digital presence by designing and developing beautiful and user-friendly websites of highest possible quality.

As a developer proficient in React and TypeScript, the web applications I build are scalable and the code I write is readable and easy to manage and expand upon, both for myself and for other developers. I donâ€™t shy away from learning new technologies, and I definitely donâ€™t mind challenges, quite the opposite. I like to constantly sharpen my problem-solving skills by tackling new projects and opportunities in order to grow as a developer.

Moreover, I would describe myself as a very responsible person who deeply cares about the end user, therefore I make sure they always have a smooth and intuitive user experience, and I like to make my web apps as secure as possible.

Last but not least, I am a team player at heart who likes to cooperate and learn from and with my colleagues and develop positive relationships at the workplace.
